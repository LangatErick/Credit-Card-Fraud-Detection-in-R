# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-in-R
this project aimed to develop machine learning models to detect credit card fraud. 
Three models were evaluated: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Decision Tree.
The results showed that the Logistic Regression model achieved the highest AUC score of 0.983,
while the Naive Bayes Classifier and Decision Tree models achieved AUC scores of 0.877 and 0.856, respectively.

The high AUC score of the Logistic Regression model indicates that it is able to accurately distinguish
between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions with a high degree of confidence. Both the Naive Bayes Classifier
and Decision Tree models also demonstrated good performance, with AUC scores of 0.877 and 0.856.

However, it is important to note that there are some limitations to the project, including the use of only three modeling
techniques and the lack of different sampling techniques. These limitations could be addressed in
future work to improve the performance of the models.

Overall, the results of this project demonstrate the potential of machine learning models in detecting credit card fraud,
and highlight the importance of
continued research and development in this field. With the increasing prevalence of credit card fraud, it is essential to develop accurate
and efficient methods for detecting and preventing fraud. This project provides a starting point for further research in this area,
and offers insights into the potential of machine learning models for detecting credit card fraud.
